  "bodyHtml": "<head></head><body><div style=\"white-space: pre-wrap\">Hi Gregor,\n\nThank you. I received report already and discussed about it internally. \n\nWith vulnerabilities found our decisions are as follows:\n\nRecommended solution to use generic error response when e-mail address is already in use or send an email to user, is not customer friendly who are sometimes not very skillful with using an IT and they need proper response for understanding what they are doing wrong. For example, Gmail also responses with message \"Account is taken\" when registering a new account with already registered name. \n\nTo use reCAPTCHA for anti bot is good recommendation, but still the attacker needs to log-in first and then start to dig with different e-mail addresses, which is not very easy to implement.\n\nI'm not aware if and what kind of protections our user account system provider (Piano Inc.) has, but they are one of the biggest solution providers for publishers around the globe and in Estonia, postimees.ee and delfi.ee are using same system. Feel free to contact to their support address support@piano.io to get more detailed answers. \n\nBecause of using international solution provider, implementing a new functionality as described your report, is not an easy job to do, but we'll discuss about it with our provider.\n\nParimat,\nUrmas Talivee</div></body>",
