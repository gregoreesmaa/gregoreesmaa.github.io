Thank You for it and its exhaustiveness. We apologise for not responding to your initial contact. The&nbsp;email was incorrectly marked as spam, and your message had never reached us. Since then, we have improved our processes related to data and GDPR requests. From now on, such requests are less likely to be falsely marked as spam and receive the attention they deserve.</div><div dir=\"ltr\"><br>Once again, the report is greatly appreciated. It highlights the issues in our system and proposes mitigations as well. It is one of the most professional communications we have seen in quite a while, and it directly helps improve our platform. For this reason, as a token of our appreciation, we would like to offer you a ResQ credit code of 15 credits, RESQ-CQGRH (valid until August 31st).<br><br>We were not aware of these issues before this. We have registered them and created a plan on how to address and fix them. We will tackle these tasks as soon as possible; however, the Finnish summer holiday season may cause a delay. If you wish, we will keep you updated after we address each of the three reported issues.<br><br>Please let us know if you have any further questions or concerns.<br><br>Best Regards,<br>ResQ.<br><br></div><br></div>\n</body>",
